<p>The Spaces SDK (Software Development Kit) provides a high-level API for the MIRROR Spaces Service and connected services of the MIRROR Spaces Framework.</p>
<p>
Central elements of the API are three major handlers:<br>
- {@link de.imc.mirror.sdk.ConnectionHandler}: A handler to establish and manage the connection to the XMPP server.<br>
- {@link de.imc.mirror.sdk.SpaceHandler}: This handler provides a set of methods to manage the spaces you can access. There are methods for the access, creation, management, and deletion of spaces.<br>
- {@link de.imc.mirror.sdk.DataHandler}: The data handler provides methods to register for notifications about newly published data, and with methods to send and retrieve it.<br>
</p>
<p>This SDK API specifies a set of interfaces to be used by platform specific implementations.</p>
