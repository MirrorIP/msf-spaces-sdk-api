MIRROR Spaces SDK API
---------------------

This project specifies the interface for Java/Android applications to handle
MIRROR spaces.

Installation
------------
This API only defines the interface. A concrete implementation is required for
the usage within a MIRROR application. 

Usage
-----

The main components of the SDK are three handlers:

de.imc.mirror.sdk.ConnectionHandler:
This handler manages the connection to the XMPP server.

de.imc.mirror.sdk.SpacesHandler:
The spaces handler provides an high-level API to retrieve, create and manage
MIRROR reflection spaces.

de.imc.mirror.sdk.DataHandler:
The data handler provides an API to send and receive data over reflection
spaces. It provides wrappers for data objects and models, enabling an object-
oriented handling of the data. Furthermore, it is possible to filter incoming
data for specific data models.

The complete API documentation is available online:
